# Manager

The Manager service is responsible for ensuring all the data is processed within
a timeframe. By default, the timeframe is a single block. If we are left with 
unprocessed data by the time a new block arrives, the manager would scale up by 
deploying more instances of the service that is currently lagging. Conversely, if
we have too many instances of a service, it will be scaled down by removing
deployments.

This service also collects runtime performance data of all the parts of the 
system and will make the information available to other third-party tools so
that performance dashboards can be constructed.

## Building

### Requirements

1. Go
2. Docker (for Redis instance)

The service is built using a Makefile, use `make help` for more information.

### Basic build and run

```shell
# Install dependencies
make dependencies

# Build
make

# Build and run
make run

# Build Docker image
make docker_build

# Run Docker image
make docker_run

# Run tests
make test
```

### Configuration

The service is configured via environment variables, they can be found and 
changed in the Makefile.
